5/Jul/17	Cq sp in DEREP is not giving the correct counts. It is currently including a terminal alkyne as 2	Fixed	Prof. John Blunt
5/Jul/17	Cq sp is missing CN and C=C=C	Fixed	Prof. John Blunt
5/Jul/17	it would be more logical to have CH3 singlet as arising from CH3-C to be consistent with CH3 doublet and triplet. The count of CH3 All - CH3 singlet would reveal other CH3s on O or N or S.	Fixed	Prof. John Blunt
5/Jul/17	There is currently no count of acetyl groups on N - quite a common feature. Count of amides would also be very useful.	Included	Prof. John Blunt
5/Jul/17	it is very useful to have counts of 1,1 and 1,2 disub alkenes, trisub alkenes and vinyl groups. Another useful count is fully substituted benzenes	Included	Prof. John Blunt
