Here is a nice contribution from Prof. John Blunt, Professor Emeritus of the School of Physical and Chemical Sciences, University of Canterbury, NEW ZEALAND.

He prepared a version of DEREP-NP to be used with ChemFinder V.r. If your version is newer than 5 you will be asked if you want to upgrade the files. No problems with that.

Enjoy
